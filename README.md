# Food_Delivery_web_app
This is a Food Delivery Web Application that I developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend.
The main purpose of this project is to allow users to browse food categories, add items to a cart, enter their details, and place an order.
